**Description:
A personal portfolio webpage project is all about showcasing who you are and what you bring to the table—your skills, accomplishments, and personality—wrapped in a visually appealing, well-structured, and interactive website.
This project focuses on designing and developing a sleek, professional personal website to highlight an individual’s background, achievements, projects, skills, and contact information. It serves as an online resume, creative showcase, and networking hub—ideal for students, professionals, designers, or developers looking to establish their online presence.
